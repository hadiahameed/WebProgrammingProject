# CS-546-Final-Project

Welcome to the Final Project of Group 1! 

Our project is called The Literary Archives. It is a website where booklovers can find books, write reviews and add books to their bookshelves. 
The main parts of the application are:
- Queriying the system for books and filtering based on genre/tags
- Bookshelves. Users by default have 3 bookshelves: read, currently reading and want to read. They can create extra bookshelves if they want to. 
- Accounts. To be able to interact with the website a user has to create an account. 
- Timeline. Users can post text, images and videos on their own timeline. Users can follow other users and view their posts in their own timeline.
